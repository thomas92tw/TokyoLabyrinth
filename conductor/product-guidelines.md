# Product Guidelines - Creative Workspace

## Prose and Narrative Style
*   **The Realist/Sociological**: Content must be grounded in real-world context and sociological observation. Use bilingual anchors (e.g., `中文關鍵字 (English Keyword)`) to ground philosophical concepts. Maintain the perspective of a calm, critical, and deeply observant traveler.

## Visual Identity
*   **High-Fidelity Minimalism**: Visuals should primarily consist of 3D isometric architectural renderings. Emphasize clean lines, realistic material textures (concrete, glass, metal), and high-contrast lighting. Use specific accent colors (like Mint Green #ddffe4) sparingly to guide the eye.

## Brand Messaging
*   **Insight and Discovery**: The core message should focus on "uncovering hidden layers." Whether through technology or literature, the goal is to reveal the unseen order, beauty, or systemic structure of urban environments and cultures.

## Content Structure
*   **Bilingual and Translatable**: All foundational concepts and key summaries must be presented in a bilingual format (e.g., Traditional Chinese and Japanese) to ensure cross-cultural depth and accessibility.
